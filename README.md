    A simple, open-source, and free, fast, secure, and reliable discord bot. <br>
    ( Also don't judge the bot by its profile picture )
  </p>

## Why nintod?

Because it's open-source! We are currently working on a lot of features (but we are also working on a lot of bugs too).
Nintod is also **free** and have **no premium tiers**. Who still have to pay for a bot? It's also **easy to use**. with a simple command.
The source code is well documented and easy to understand (Because we write comments in the code, all lines).
You can help us by contributing to the project. Because we love open-source, isn't that right?
